## Getting Started

The Cancrizans web app includes an interactive tutorial system that guides you
through understanding crab canons. This document outlines the tutorial flow.

## Tutorial Steps Overview

### Step 1: Welcome
**Goal**: Introduce the concept of crab canons

Students learn:
- What a crab canon is (musical palindrome)
- That Bach's example is from The Musical Offering
- The tutorial will be interactive and hands-on

### Step 2: Musical Palindromes
**Goal**: Understand the palindrome concept

Students learn:
- Comparison to word palindromes
- Voice 1 = forward, Voice 2 = backward
- Both start simultaneously

### Step 3: Listen
**Goal**: Hear the canon in action

**Action Required**: Click the Play button

Students observe:
- How both voices create harmony
- The sound of temporal symmetry
- Forward and backward motion simultaneously

### Step 4: Visualize Symmetry
**Goal**: See the palindrome structure

Focus on: **Mirror View canvas**

Students observe:
- Blue = Voice 1 (forward)
- Red = Voice 2 (backward)
- Center line = the "mirror"
- Perfect symmetry

### Step 5: Musical Notation
**Goal**: Read traditional notation

Focus on: **Notation container**

Students learn:
- Two staves show both voices
- Voice 2 would be read right-to-left
- Traditional notation of puzzle canons

### Step 6: Tempo Control
**Goal**: Experiment with speed

**Action Required**: Adjust tempo slider

Students discover:
- Slower = easier to hear symmetry
- Faster = more exciting
- Bach's intended tempo: ~84 BPM

### Step 7: Isolate Voices
**Goal**: Hear each voice independently

**Action Required**: Toggle mute checkboxes

Students practice:
- Mute Voice 2 → hear forward melody
- Mute Voice 1 → hear retrograde
- Understand each voice's character

### Step 8: Composer Introduction
**Goal**: Prepare to create own canon

Focus on: **Canon Builder section**

Students learn:
- Click to add notes
- Drag to move notes
- Shift+click to delete
- Red notes = automatic retrograde

### Step 9: Templates
**Goal**: Start with pre-made example

**Action Required**: Select and play template

Students explore:
- Different melodic shapes
- How templates become canons
- Inspiration for own compositions

### Step 10: Experiment
**Goal**: Create original canon

**Action Required**: Compose and play own melody

Students practice:
- Independent composition
- Trial and error
- Listening critically

### Step 11: Completion
**Goal**: Review and celebrate

Students reflect on:
- Key concepts learned
- Crab canon = musical palindrome
- Two voices in opposite directions
- Bach's compositional genius

## Teaching Tips

### Before Starting Tutorial
1. Ensure audio is working
2. Demo the play button first
3. Set expectations: "Follow the prompts"

### During Tutorial
- Let students work at their own pace
- Encourage experimentation in Step 10
- Circulate to help struggling students
- Ask reflection questions between steps

### After Tutorial
- Class discussion: "What was your favorite part?"
- Share created canons
- Connect to broader music history
- Assign follow-up composition homework

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Tutorial won't start
**Solution**: Refresh page, check JavaScript console

### Issue: Audio not playing
**Solution**:
- Check browser permissions
- Click anywhere first (Chrome requirement)
- Try different browser

### Issue: Can't hear symmetry
**Solution**:
- Slow down tempo to 60 BPM
- Mute voices individually first
- Try with headphones

### Issue: Composer tool confusing
**Solution**:
- Start with Step 9 (templates)
- Watch teacher demo first
- Pair students for peer learning

---

## Extensions

### For Quick Learners
- Skip to composer immediately
- Challenge: Create canon with 12+ notes
- Try creating an invertible canon

### For Struggling Learners
- Repeat Steps 1-7 multiple times
- Focus on listening, not creating
- Use only templates (skip free composition)

### Class Activities
- **Canon Gallery**: Display all student canons
- **Performance**: Each student plays their canon
- **Peer Review**: Rate each other's compositions
- **Research**: Find other crab canons in music history

## Assessment Ideas

### Formative Assessment (During Tutorial)
- Observe: Can student navigate independently?
- Ask: "Explain what a retrograde is"
- Check: Can student create a simple canon?

### Summative Assessment (After Tutorial)
1. **Listening Test**: Play canon, identify voices
2. **Composition**: Create original crab canon
3. **Written Reflection**: Explain concept in essay
4. **Presentation**: Share canon with class

### Rubric Criteria
- Technical Understanding (25%)
- Musical Quality (25%)
- Creativity (25%)
- Engagement & Effort (25%)
