## True/False Questions

1. **T** / F: A crab canon is a type of musical palindrome
2. T / **F**: Voice 2 starts when Voice 1 finishes (Both start together!)
3. **T** / F: Bach wrote the Crab Canon as part of The Musical Offering
4. **T** / F: Retrograde means playing a melody backward in time
5. T / **F**: All canons must have exactly two voices (Can have more!)
6. **T** / F: The Cancrizans web app can automatically generate the retrograde voice
7. T / **F**: A crab canon and a round are the same thing (Different!)
8. **T** / F: Augmentation makes note durations longer (slower)
9. **T** / F: Diminution makes note durations shorter (faster)
10. T / **F**: You need to be a professional musician to create a simple crab canon (No!)

## Short Answer Questions

1. **Define "retrograde" in your own words.**
   - *Expected answer*: Playing a melody backward in time, starting from the end and going to the beginning

2. **Explain why a crab canon is called a "palindrome."**
   - *Expected answer*: Like a word palindrome that reads the same forwards and backwards, a crab canon sounds the same when played in both directions

3. **Describe what happens in Bach's Crab Canon.**
   - *Expected answer*: Voice 1 plays the melody forward while Voice 2 plays the exact same melody backward, both starting at the same time

4. **What is the difference between retrograde and inversion?**
   - *Expected answer*: Retrograde reverses time (backward), inversion flips pitches (up/down reversed)

5. **Name two ways to vary a canon theme.**
   - *Expected answers*: Augmentation (slower), diminution (faster), transposition (different key), inversion (flipped pitches), etc.

## Essay/Discussion Questions

1. **Why do you think Bach created puzzle canons like the Crab Canon? What purpose did they serve?**

2. **Describe the mathematical relationship between the two voices in a crab canon. Use the terms "symmetry" and "transformation."**

3. **Compare and contrast a crab canon with a traditional round (like "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"). How are they similar? How are they different?**

4. **Explain how technology (like the Cancrizans app) changes the way we learn about and create crab canons compared to Bach's time.**

5. **If you were to explain crab canons to a younger student, what example or analogy would you use?**
