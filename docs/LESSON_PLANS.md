## Overview

These lesson plans introduce students to crab canons (canon cancrizans) through
Bach's famous example from *The Musical Offering* (BWV 1079).

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Palindromes (30 minutes)

### Learning Objectives
- Understand what a palindrome is
- Recognize palindromes in language and music
- Identify forward vs. backward motion

### Materials Needed
- Cancrizans web application
- Examples of word palindromes
- Audio playback capability

### Lesson Plan

**1. Word Palindromes (5 minutes)**
- Show examples: "racecar", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
- Students identify what makes them special
- Discussion: "What would a musical palindrome be?"

**2. Musical Palindromes (10 minutes)**
- Explain retrograde motion in music
- Play a simple melody forward and backward
- Introduce the concept of simultaneous forward/backward

**3. Bach's Crab Canon (10 minutes)**
- Open Cancrizans web app
- Play Bach's example (both voices together)
- Mute voices individually to hear each direction
- Show mirror view visualization

**4. Discussion (5 minutes)**
- How does it sound? Is it beautiful?
- Why is it called "crab" canon?
- What makes this compositionally challenging?

### Assessment
- Students explain palindrome concept in their own words
- Students identify which voice is forward vs. backward
- Exit ticket: "Why is a crab canon harder than a regular canon?"

## Lesson 2: Creating Your Own Canon (45 minutes)

### Learning Objectives
- Compose a simple melodic theme
- Understand how retrograde works
- Create and perform a crab canon

### Materials Needed
- Cancrizans web application (composer tool)
- Staff paper (optional)
- Pencils

### Lesson Plan

**1. Review (5 minutes)**
- Recap palindrome concept from Lesson 1
- Quick listen to Bach's canon

**2. Composing a Theme (15 minutes)**
- Open the Interactive Canon Builder
- Demonstrate: click to add notes
- Students create 4-8 note melody
- Keep it simple: stepwise motion, simple rhythms

**3. Automatic Retrograde (10 minutes)**
- Show how red notes appear automatically
- Explain: computer generates the backward voice
- Play the canon to hear both voices

**4. Refinement (10 minutes)**
- Students adjust their melodies
- Listen for harmony and consonance
- Try different templates for inspiration

**5. Performance & Sharing (5 minutes)**
- Students play their canons for class
- Discussion: Which ones sound best? Why?

### Assessment
- Students successfully create a working crab canon
- Can explain how retrograde is generated
- Peer evaluation of compositions

## Lesson 3: Analysis & History (30 minutes)

### Learning Objectives
- Understand historical context of The Musical Offering
- Analyze harmonic structure of crab canons
- Recognize contrapuntal techniques

### Materials Needed
- Cancrizans analysis tools
- Historical information about Bach
- Score/notation view

### Lesson Plan

**1. Historical Context (10 minutes)**
- Frederick the Great's musical challenge to Bach
- The Musical Offering collection
- Puzzle canons and musical riddles of the Baroque

**2. Musical Analysis (15 minutes)**
- Use CLI analysis tools (if available)
- Examine consonance/dissonance ratios
- Interval analysis: what intervals does Bach use?
- Rhythm analysis: note duration patterns

**3. Compositional Techniques (5 minutes)**
- How did Bach ensure it sounds good both ways?
- Symmetry in harmony
- Voice leading principles

### Assessment
- Students identify 3 facts about The Musical Offering
- Can explain one contrapuntal technique Bach uses
- Written reflection on Bach's compositional skill

## Lesson 4: Advanced Exploration (45 minutes)

### Learning Objectives
- Explore other canon types (augmentation, diminution)
- Compare multiple crab canons
- Create variations on Bach's theme

### Materials Needed
- Cancrizans CLI research tools
- Examples directory with multiple canons
- Composer tool

### Lesson Plan

**1. Canon Types (15 minutes)**
- Demonstrate augmentation (slower retrograde)
- Demonstrate diminution (faster retrograde)
- Show mirror canon (retrograde + inversion)
- Listen to examples 06-10

**2. Comparative Analysis (15 minutes)**
- Use research command to analyze all examples
- Compare consonance ratios
- Which canons are more/less harmonious?
- Statistical patterns across the corpus

**3. Creative Variations (10 minutes)**
- Students create variations on Bach's theme
- Try transposing (change key)
- Apply augmentation/diminution
- Combine with inversion

**4. Reflection (5 minutes)**
- What did we learn about palindromic music?
- How has technology changed music education?
- Where else do we see mathematical patterns in music?

### Assessment
- Students create one canon variation
- Can explain difference between canon types
- Final project: Research presentation on canons

## Extension Activities

### For Advanced Students
1. **Composition Challenge**: Create a crab canon that is also invertible
2. **Research Project**: Find other composers who used crab canons
3. **Programming**: Modify the code to create new visualizations

### For Struggling Students
1. **Guided Composition**: Use templates, modify just one or two notes
2. **Visual Learning**: Focus on mirror view, trace symmetry
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify repeated patterns in Bach's canon

### Cross-Curricular Connections
- **Mathematics**: Symmetry, transformations, group theory
- **Computer Science**: Algorithms, recursion, data structures
- **Language Arts**: Palindromes, poetic structure
- **Art**: Visual symmetry, mirror images
